# Introduction

OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-language, cross-platform application
programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.

It is widely used in:

- Video games
- Simulations
- Scientific visualization

OpenGL provides a set of functions that allow developers to:

- Create and manipulate graphics objects
- Apply transformations
- Control the rendering process

It is designed to be hardware-independent, allowing applications to run on
a variety of platforms and devices.

OpenGL is maintained by the **Khronos Group**, a consortium responsible for
open standard graphics and compute APIs.
